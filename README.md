## 🚀 What It Does

Whenever a User Sends an Expense Message via Telegram (e.g., `₹200 Lunch at Subway` or `Cab - ₹450`), this AI agent:

1. Uses **Gemini API** to Extract and Interpret:
   - **Amount**
   - **Item**
   - **Category** (e.g., Food, Travel, Entertainment)
   - **Description**
   - **Date** (or Assigns the Current Timestamp if Missing)

2. Writes the Parsed Data into an Excel File with the following structure:  
   `Date | Item | Amount | Category | Description`

✅ Supports Messages with currency symbols  
✅ Intelligently categorizes expenses using Gemini  
✅ Uses Current Timestamp When Date is Missing
